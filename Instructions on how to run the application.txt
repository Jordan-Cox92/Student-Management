To run the application:

1. After you copy down the code, the backend should be run in visual studio.  Once you've opened visual studio, you should
click the arrow (the one closer to the left side of the page) to run it.  Swagger will pop up.  

2. After this, you would need to run the front end.  In order to do this, you must go inside the client folder in your terminal
and then run npm start.  The frontend and backend should now be running and working together.

3. You can log-in with mrjordancolby@gmail.com.  The password is Keyun1234!
